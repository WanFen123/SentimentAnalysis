# SentimentAnalysis

The *objectives* of this project are as below:-
1. To pre-process and classify tweets into polarity.
2. To determine the most appropriate algorithm in classifying tweets into polarity.
3. To identify the users' perception towards public transportation.

The *methodology* of this project are described as below:-
**1. Data collection.**
Data is extracted or crawled from Twitter.
**2. Data preprocessing.**
Some steps such as data cleaning, stemming, stop-words removal are carried out.
**3. Lexicon-based algorithm.**
Three different standard lexical resources are implemented to calculate the sentiment score of each tweet.
**4. Machine learning algorithm.**
The entire dataset is partitioned into 60:40. Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest are the supervised machine learning algorithms used to train the model.
**5. Performance metrics.**
The performance of each algorithm is investigated using confusion matrix. The accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score of each algorithm are studied.
